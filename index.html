            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently an accounts payable executive of seven years. I am planning on a career change, and
                to work towards this I am undertaking a programming bootcamp, with the and goal of entering into a new
                career in software development.</p>
            <p>Before my current role I had worked for a brief stint at ASDA after graduating from University with a
            degree in physics but with no real plans for what I would do after uni.</p>
            <p>Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my friends. I am a computer enthusiast and I have built my own
                gaming PC. I also enjoy unwinding by painting miniature models in my free time.</p>
